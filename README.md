# bacterial-tolerance-rate-svm
a support vector based machine learning to predict the tolerance rates in the bacterial infections. It uses eps-regression and although the c-type classification can be applied if you want to predict the time variable: applying support vector machine to predict and fine tune a model to predict the tolerance rates based on the timing, age and exposure to a bacterial species.
> if you change the type to c-classification and uses the time formula then it accurately predicts the onset of the bacterial rates. Data supplied online from github bioinformatics and sample data is there.
